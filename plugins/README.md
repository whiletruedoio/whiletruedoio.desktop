# Collections Plugins Directory

This directory can be used to ship various plugins inside an Ansible collection.
Each plugin is placed in a folder that is named after the type of plugin it is
in. It can also include the `module_utils` and `modules` directory that would
contain module utils and modules respectively.

The documentation for the structure can be found
[here](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/dev_guide/developing_collections_structure.html#plugins-directory).
